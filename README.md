# CodeIntegrationFinch
First year code integration task for group project. Please find main method in CodeIntegration.java

This project consisted of 7 group members coding a mode for the Finch robot, and then putting all the modes together in one program. Detect Object was my task which has two modes:
Scaredy Finch - If an object is detected, the finch should move away in a random direction.
Curious Finch - If an object is detected, the finch should follow the object.
